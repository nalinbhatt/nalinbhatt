# Hello <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> <br> 

I am Nalin Bhatt. I am currently pursuing a MA in Computational Social Science (Econ Concentration) at The University of Chicago. 
I did my undergraduate degree in Economics with a double Minor in Data Analysis and Math from George Mason University(class of 2021). 

I previously worked as an Economics Intern at [Agoric](https://agoric.com/roadmap) under Dr. Bill Tulloh and before that I was a research assistant to [Dr. Kevin McCabe](https://github.com/Kmccabe) at [The Center for the Study of Neuroeconomics](https://github.com/gmucsn). 

## Thesis Related 
*. [Comparing Economic Efficiency between Bilateral Exchange and Automated Market Makers for P2P Energy Markets](https://github.com/nalinbhatt/p2p_solar_abm)
    - Translated MASON Java Model to Python from Monroe et. al 2023 *"Evaluating Peer-to-Peer Electricity Markets across the U.S. Using an Agent-Based Modeling Approach"*
    - Replicated baseline results from a detailed model of solar electricity production and demand 
    - Compared the performance of agents when Automated Market Makers were used as a means of exchange 
    - [Parallelized simulations over a computing cluster](https://github.com/macs30123-s24/final-project-p2p-abms)


## Projects 
I have contributed to the following projects <br>

1. [Inter Protocol ABM](https://github.com/gmucsn/block_chain)
    * Created an ABM model to represent Inter Protocol
    * Created Actors to represent Vaults, Automated Market Maker , Parity Stability Module, and Liquidator 
1. [Decentralized Exchanges](https://github.com/gmucsn/workshop_2021/tree/main/project_amm) (ongoing)
    * We are currently modelling the Uniswap v2 Exchange using [mTree](https://github.com/gmucsn/mTree)(python library for creating concurrent ABMs).
    * Working paper [Modeling Arbitrage with an Automated Market Maker](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4247283)

2. [Transaction Escrow](https://github.com/gmucsn/reu_2020_main) 
    * We created an experiment in mTree to study the effects of online transaction escrow mechanism on trading behavior. (ongoing)
    * The experiment is pending execution with human subjects
  
3. [Voluntary Contribution Mechanism](https://github.com/gmucsn/reu_2020_vcm)(VCM)
    * Created an Agent Based Model to recreate VCM in mTree.
