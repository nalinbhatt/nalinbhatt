During my reu experience I have helped contribute to the following projects <br>

    * We had the opportunity to model the Uniswap v2 Exchange using [mTree](https://github.com/gmucsn/mTree)(python library for creating concurrent ABMs) 

2. [Transaction Escrow](https://github.com/gmucsn/reu_2020_main) 
    * We created an experiment in mTree to study online transaction escrow mechanism. (ongoing)
